# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


PS: I was bored and I created a Currency Converter using JavaScript, HTML and CSS. (Don't really know why I used react for this)


Also, wanted to work on my JavaScript programming skills as I am hopeing to find a job as a Front-end Dev :)
